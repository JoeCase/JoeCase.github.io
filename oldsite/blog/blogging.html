      <p>Building my own site has been very rewarding. I have built sites in the past and actually building a website was what initially got me into being more interesting in programming. I did more work in the past with frameworks such as wordpress, tweaking those templates and playing around with that. But doing it from scratch not only gives you a lot of opportunities for creativity, but also great experiences for learning new skills. </p>

<p>I have to say that hard coding html, especially blog posts can be a bit of a pain. I am looking forward to in the future using different kinds of frameworks and template engines to make things better and easier to use. Actually building a blog app that other people can use is one of the projects I want to accomplish while at Dev Bootcamp.</p>
