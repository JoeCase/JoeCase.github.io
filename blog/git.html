      Version control is an essential and beneficial tool to allow distributed development. With more people working on software at the same time great gains can be made. Version control allows this type of development without the risks or people working from bad code or people rewriting other peopleâ€™s code.</p>

      <p>Git helps you keep track of changes by creating waypoints during development that allow you to revert back to if anything breaks or goes wrong, which is quite likely in development. By allowing you to stage and then finally commit changes, it keeps track of your trail in case you would need to retrace it.</p>

      <p>Github is a fantastic place to store code as it allows a failsafe cloud based storage solution (so you always know it is safe) and also allows for distributed development so many different people in any location can work on the same code and ensure it is version controlled across systems.</p>
