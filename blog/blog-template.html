      Version control is an essential and beneficial tool to allow distributed development. With more people working on software at the same time great gains can be made. Version control allows this type of development without the risks or people working from bad code or people rewriting other people’s code.</p>

      <p>Git helps you keep track of changes by creating waypoints during development that allow you to revert back to if anything breaks or goes wrong, which is quite likely in development. By allowing you to stage and then finally commit changes, it keeps track of your trail in case you would need to retrace it.</p>

      <p>Github is a fantastic place to store code as it allows a failsafe cloud based storage solution (so you always know it is safe) and also allows for distributed development so many different people in any location can work on the same code and ensure it is version controlled across systems.</p>

How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
  It was fun to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair. Collaboration is especially fun in the design realm I believe.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
  Yes I found wire framing to be helpful. I like to do a kind of combination or wireframe/style. With something as simple as a blog post it is nice, but maybe not completely necessary. Whereas with more complex sites and applications, I think wire framing is an absolutely essential part of the process.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 
  We decided that keeping it as basic as possible made a good wireframe, especially since it was going just to HTML.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
  I learned about the <article> tag which my pair told me about. Seems a great way to organize blog post content.
