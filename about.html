      <p>Joe Case is a filmmaker, producer, writer, visual artist, music maker and now coder.</p>

<p>Growing up around Detroit, Joe obtained a philosophy degree from the University of Michigan before making his first films at night while doing time in a big advertising agency. He went through the bootcamp of LA commercial film production before moving to Paris where he obtained an MFA in film directing. His educational background taught him to distill meaning to its core elements, and portray it in aesthetically pleasing ways... with or without pouty French actresses. </p>

<p>While living in Paris he traveled extensively shooting and directing videos of high performance sports cars and producing TV segments of the European fashion scene. He then moved back to the US and launched the storytelling company TeKino. </p>

<p>While film is his first medium, he has branched into projections, graphics, LED art and any number of combinations of those things.</p>

<p>He is now learning to code and will soon be the king of a vast app empire that brings justice, peace and prosperity to all the lands on earth.</p>
