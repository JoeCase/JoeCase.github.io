      <p>To the outside world, Ruby and rails are often considered to be the same thing, or at least one inseparable thing: Ruby on Rails. It is the magic system that you can make web apps with quickly and easily!</p>

<p>But they are not the same. Ruby is a programming language and Rails is a framework, specifically a web application framework, that is written in Ruby. A framework is what is sounds like. It is a pre made architectures that allows you to not write an application from the ground up. It gives you a starting point and then it gives you tools to keep building on top of the basic architecture. You can think of it kind of like a prefab house. The basic structure is there, and then you can fill it out and build it out how you want it to. The plumbing is set up, the electrical is already done and you have some empty rooms to fill in. The great thing is, you can also start adding on other rooms, or adding appliances to the rooms (that are already built) and you know they will work with the plumbing, wiring and other rooms in the house. Everything is standardized. So you can start with a basic structure, and shop from a series of already made tools that will allow you to construct your house how you want it, without needing to build or make every couch, bathroom, ceiling fan, and basement yourself. </p>

<p>Rails actually came from someone building a web app in Ruby. It was a guy named David Hansson and it came from his work on the project management application Basecamp, which I used to use! I think a lot of people were familiar with it. It quickly became more popular as large companies began to build their products on it, such as Twitter. </p>

<p>Rails is constructed on a model-view-controller structure to organize an applications and it is based on DRY principles. It makes getting all the foundation and piping of a web application up and running pretty instantly, and then letting you modify it. I sincerely can&rsquo;t wait to become Rails fluent, because I have ideas for a lot of web apps.</p>
